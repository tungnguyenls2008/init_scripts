# init_scripts
a collection of easy to use bash scripts, the main goal is to save web devs the time to initiate new projects with common stacks.
right now we have:
-Laravel + Vue + MySQL
-Laravel + Vue + MongoDB

all are dockerized and separated, so install docker if you haven't yet.
all are in their latest version.
all are free to use.
with UI to manage databases, mailpit to test mail.

todo: 
-add more tools (test, cache,...)
-maybe add a start point for microservice?
