# init_scripts
a collection of easy to use bash scripts, the main goal is to save web devs the time to initiate new projects with common stacks.
## right now we have:
-Laravel + Vue + MySQL

-Laravel + Vue + MongoDB

## note: 
all are dockerized and separated, so install docker if you haven't yet.

all are in their latest version.

all are free to use.

with UI to manage databases, mailpit to test mail.

the thing is things may break, this depends on changes they make on latest versions, so add the specific version to each services if you want to stay in the safezone
## todo: 
-add more tools (test, cache,...)

-maybe add a start point for microservice?
